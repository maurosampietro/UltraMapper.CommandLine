A nicely coded commandline parser for .NET 



What is UltraMapper.CommandLine?
--------------------------------

UltraMapper.CommandLine is a .NET command line parser, that is, a tool that avoids you the need to write the code needed to parse and map command line arguments to strongly typed objects.

UltraMapper.CommandLine provides 2 game-changing features:

-   Allows you to <b>call methods directly</b>
-   Allows you to work with custom user-defined types (eg: classes, hereby called simply 'complex types')
    Complex types support inheritance
-   Allows you to work with collections of complex types

Example:


UltraMapper.CommandLine is powered by [UltraMapper](https://github.com/maurosampietro/UltraMapper), a powerful .NET mapper!

Key features
--------------------------------

- <b>Direct method call</b> supporting unlimited input parameters
- <b>Complex types</b> support for both <b>properties</b> and <b>methods</b>
- <b>Nesting</b>. Complex types can be nested in other complex types.
- Complex types support <b>unlimited inheritance</b>.
- <b>Collections</b> (IEnumerable<>, List<>, arrays) of both <b>primitive</b> and <b>complex types</b> support
- Automatic <b>help generator</b>
- A <b>simple JSON like syntax</b> supporting all of this!
